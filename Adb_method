ADB stands for Android Debug Bridge, and is something you really should
have working, I dont intend to enter into a long tutorial on how to
install and set this up, but someone at google has
<http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html>. Make sure you have
enabled 'USB Debugging' on your device (goto Settings / Applications /
Development).

Once you have adb type the following commands:

adb push install /data/local/
adb shell chmod 04755 /data/local/install
adb shell /data/local/install


you should see something like following:

Android ROM dumper v0.72b
(c)2010 Sebastian404
[*] Android local root exploid (C) The Android Exploid Crew
[+] Using basedir=/sqlite_stmt_journals, path=/data/local/install
[+] opening NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT socket
[+] sending add message ...
[*] Try to invoke hotplug now, clicking at the wireless
[*] settings, plugin USB key etc.
[*] You succeeded if you find /system/bin/romdump.


Once you see that you need to turn your Wifi on and off, usualy in
Settings / Wireless & Networks / Wi-Fi

now thats done, type the following:

adb shell romdump


then wait for it to finish, it can take a while.
