You need to install a terminal application from the Android Market, I
recomend google's own, but as long as its free.

Once you have installed it, copy the downloaded install file to the root
of your sdcard, then launch your terminal application and type the
following commands:

cat /sdcard/install >/data/local/install
chmod 04755 /data/local/install
/data/local/install


you should see something like following:

Android ROM dumper v0.72b
(c)2010 Sebastian404
[*] Android local root exploid (C) The Android Exploid Crew
[+] Using basedir=/sqlite_stmt_journals, path=/data/local/install
[+] opening NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT socket
[+] sending add message ...
[*] Try to invoke hotplug now, clicking at the wireless
[*] settings, plugin USB key etc.
[*] You succeeded if you find /system/bin/romdump.


Once you see that you need to turn your Wifi on and off, usualy in
Settings / Wireless & Networks / Wi-Fi

now thats done, you will need to launch the terminal application one
more, and type the following:

/system/bin/romdump


then wait for it to finish, it can take a while.
